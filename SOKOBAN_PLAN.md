# ðŸŽ® Sokoban TypeScript Implementation - 5 Day Journey

---

## ðŸ“… DAY 1: Friday 10/31 (2-3 hours)
**TAGLINE:** *"I'm not pushing boxes, I'm pushing BOUNDARIES, darling!"*

**DAY NAME:** Foundation Friday (aka "Type Safety is My Love Language")

**MOTIVATIONAL QUOTE:** *"Beginnings are a practice of courage. Each new thing we learn reminds us we can grow."* - Jack Kornfield

### OBJECTIVES:
1. **Set up project structure** - Initialize TypeScript + Vitest, create folder architecture (`src/types/`, `src/core/`, `src/renderer/`, `tests/`)
2. **Define core types** - Create `Position`, `GameState`, `Cell` types with proper interfaces (immutable state pattern)
3. **Implement grid representation** - Build 2D base grid + separate `Set<Position>` for boxes, goals, player position
4. **Write level parser** - Read `.txt` files and convert to GameState (handle `#`, `@`, `$`, `.`, `*` symbols)
5. **Create basic renderer** - Terminal output function that displays current grid state with ASCII art
6. **Write first tests** - Test level parsing with Claude's help (valid format, invalid format, edge cases)

**GIFT:** 15-minute walk outside to celebrate your types compiling without errors âœ¨

**READ:** *"Honey, I've seen more structure in a Real Housewives reunion fight than in some codebases, but YOU? You're about to serve architectural realness. Now stop overthinking those interfaces and just TYPE them out, babe. The compiler's got your back, unlike some exes we know."*

## ðŸ“… DAY 2: Monday 11/3 (4 hours)
**TAGLINE:** *"While you were moving boxes, I was making MOVES, honey!"*

**DAY NAME:** Mechanic Monday (aka "Push It Real Good")

**MOTIVATIONAL QUOTE:** *"Compassion for ourselves gives rise to the power to transform, not through struggle but through understanding."* - Jack Kornfield

### OBJECTIVES:
1. **Implement basic movement validation** - Function to check if position is valid (not wall, not out of bounds)
2. **Build player movement logic** - Update player position, return new immutable GameState
3. **Write box pushing mechanics** - Detect box collision, check if push is valid, update BOTH positions atomically
4. **Handle all edge cases** - Can't push into walls, can't push 2 boxes, can't push into another box
5. **Create comprehensive test suite** - Use Claude to generate tests for all movement combinations and edge cases
6. **Implement move counter** - Track moves in GameState, increment on valid moves only

**GIFT:** Your favorite comfort meal while watching one episode of something trashy (you've earned it!)

**READ:** *"Listen sweetheart, I know you're scared of those edge cases, but running from them is like showing up to the reunion in last season's dress - it's NOT gonna work. Face those corner-pushing, wall-adjacent, double-box scenarios HEAD ON. You didn't come this far to only come this far. Now test those boundaries like you're testing a friendship at a dinner party."*

## ðŸ“… DAY 3: Tuesday 11/4 (2 hours)
**TAGLINE:** *"I didn't come here to play games... wait, actually I DID!"*

**DAY NAME:** Terminal Tuesday (aka "CLI Queen Energy")

**MOTIVATIONAL QUOTE:** *"In the end, only three things matter: how fully we have lived, how deeply we have loved, and how well we have learned to let go."* - Jack Kornfield

### OBJECTIVES:
1. **Build CLI argument parser** - Accept `--level levels/level1.txt` command line args
2. **Create game loop** - Render â†’ read input â†’ update â†’ check win â†’ repeat cycle
3. **Implement keyboard input handling** - Listen for WASD/arrow keys in terminal (use `readline` or similar)
4. **Add screen clearing** - Terminal clear between renders for smooth "animation" feel
5. **Create UI display** - Show move counter, controls legend, current level name
6. **Handle graceful exit** - Press 'q' to quit, proper cleanup

**GIFT:** 20 minutes of your favorite music, no screens, just vibes ðŸŽµ

**READ:** *"Baby, you're on day 3 and your game loop is tighter than the storylines on Vanderpump Rules - and that's saying something! But don't get cocky, miss thing. That input handling can be MESSY, and we both know messy doesn't win Best Dressed at the reunion. Keep it clean, keep it async, and for the love of RuPaul, test that 'q' key works before you trap yourself in an infinite loop."*

---

## ðŸ“… DAY 4: Wednesday 11/5 (3 hours)
**TAGLINE:** *"My code is like my personality: complex, layered, and occasionally needs debugging."*

**DAY NAME:** Win-Condition Wednesday (aka "Victory Lap Realness")

**MOTIVATIONAL QUOTE:** *"The goal is not to be better than anyone else, but to be better than you used to be."* - Jack Kornfield

### OBJECTIVES:
1. **Implement win detection** - Check if all box positions match goal positions (Set comparison magic)
2. **Create victory screen** - Display win message, final move count, option to continue/quit
3. **Add restart functionality** - Press 'r' to reload current level from initial state
4. **Build level file validator** - Ensure exactly 1 player, equal boxes/goals, valid characters only
5. **Error handling polish** - Graceful messages for file not found, invalid levels, etc.
6. **Integration testing** - Test complete game flows from start to win with Claude's help

**GIFT:** A meditation session or gentle yoga flow - your brain deserves some peace ðŸ§˜

**READ:** *"Okay, we need to talk. You've built the mechanics, you've built the loop, but can you stick the landing? This is your floor routine, babe, and the judges are WATCHING. Win detection seems simple until you realize your Sets aren't comparing properly and suddenly every level is 'won' before you even move. Don't phone it in now - this is where good coders become GREAT coders. Make that algorithm SING, darling."*

## ðŸ“… DAY 5: Thursday 11/6 (4 hours)
**TAGLINE:** *"I'm not just a box-pusher, I'm a LEGACY builder!"*

**DAY NAME:** Polish & Prestige Thursday (aka "Reunion Ready Code")

**MOTIVATIONAL QUOTE:** *"True freedom comes from the capacity to pause between stimulus and response."* - Jack Kornfield

### OBJECTIVES:
1. **Add ANSI terminal colors** - Walls (gray), boxes (yellow), goals (green), player (cyan), box-on-goal (bright green)
2. **Implement multiple levels** - Level progression system, load next level on completion
3. **Create sample level collection** - At least 3 levels of increasing difficulty in `levels/` folder
4. **Build comprehensive README** - Installation, usage, controls, screenshots (ASCII art counts!), architecture overview
5. **Write E2E tests** - Full gameplay scenarios with test levels using Claude
6. **STRETCH: Undo system** - If time allows, implement move history stack with 'u' key to undo (immutable state makes this easier!)

**GIFT:** Whatever you want - you just built a complete game from scratch, you LEGEND ðŸŽ‰

**READ:** *"Look at you, honey. LOOK. AT. YOU. You started this week not knowing how Sokoban worked internally, and now you're about to deploy a fully-tested, TypeScript-powered, terminal-rendered masterpiece. Is the undo system optional? Yes. Is it also the cherry on top that'll make interviewers GAG? Also yes. But whether you get to it or not, you've already won, babe. This README you're about to write? That's your crowning moment. Make it SICKENING. You're not just showcasing code - you're showcasing GROWTH. Now go collect your trophy (and maybe actually take a day off after this, because self-care is also competence)."*

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

By the end of Thursday, you'll have:
- âœ… **Fully functional Sokoban game** with all core mechanics
- âœ… **TypeScript mastery demonstrated** through types, interfaces, immutability patterns
- âœ… **Comprehensive test suite** (unit + integration)
- âœ… **Portfolio-ready code** with README and clean architecture
- âœ… **Interview talking points** about algorithms, state management, and testing strategies
- âœ… **Bonus visual polish** with terminal colors
- ðŸŒŸ **Optional undo** if time permits (but you're already a star without it!)

---

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack
- **TypeScript** (strict mode, because we're professionals)
- **Vitest** (fast, modern, fabulous)
- **Node.js built-ins** (fs, readline, process)
- **ANSI escape codes** (terminal colors without dependencies)

## ðŸŽ¬ Final Wisdom

This isn't just about Sokoban. This is about proving to yourself that you can:
1. **Plan** complex systems
2. **Execute** with discipline
3. **Test** thoroughly
4. **Ship** with confidence

Every box you push in this game is practice for pushing through imposter syndrome. Every wall you code is a boundary you're setting with self-doubt. Every test you write is proof that you KNOW your code works.

You've got this. Now go build something you're proud of. ðŸ’…âœ¨

*Remember: The code doesn't have to be perfect. It has to be DONE. Perfection is the enemy of shipped products, honey.*
